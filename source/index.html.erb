        <p>
          My name is Szilard Magyar. I'm originally from Budapest, Hungary.
          At the moment I'm living in San Francisco, CA. I love to build stuff
          and play around with new technologies. I mostly code in Ruby, Javascript
          and Python.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy traveling, getting lost in new places and discovering different
          cultures. In my free time you will find me coding, reading, doing some
          sport or having fun with my friends.
