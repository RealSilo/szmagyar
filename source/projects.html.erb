              <p>I decided to pick up web development in 2015 to be able to implement my <u><%= link_to "app", "https://faskyn.com" %></u> that aimed to make the communication simple between products and corporations.</p>
              <p>My choice of framework was Ruby on Rails because it's great to develop documentlike apps quickly and it's not that hard to learn thanks to its maturity and the huge community behind it.</p>

              <p>The full stack was the following: RoR, jQuery, SASS, Bootstrap, AJAX, Heroku, Postgres, Puma, AWS (S3 and Cloudfront), Redis, Sidekiq, Pusher, RSpec, Capybara.</p>

              <p>For a while I was working as a Ruby developer and have taken part in building different monolith/only API Rails and various Ruby applications including:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><%= link_to "My SMS Group", "https://www.sms-group.com/" %> (ruby, sinatra API, rspec, capybara, docker)</li>
                <li><%= link_to "Sennheiser", "http://en-de.sennheiser.com/" %> (rails, rspec, capybara)</li>
                <li><%= link_to "Flickr image parser gem", "https://rubygems.org/gems/imagecollage" %> (ruby, rspec, Flickr API)</li>
              </ul>

              <h4><u>JAVASCIRPT</u></h4>
              <p>I also enjoy playing around with React and Redux. Some small apps I built with React when I got started:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><%= link_to "BART schedule", "http://bartschedulesilo.herokuapp.com/", target: "_blank" %> (React, BART API, Heroku, Bootstrap), <%= link_to "GitHub", "https://github.com/RealSilo/TransportationApp", target: "_blank" %></li>
                <li><%= link_to "Todo app", "http://reacttodosilo.herokuapp.com/" %> (react, redux, firebase, heroku, foundations), <%= link_to "GitHub", "https://github.com/RealSilo/ReactTodoApp", target: "_blank" %></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Currently I am working at Warrenpay where our frontend is built with React+Redux. You can check the app here:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><%= link_to "Warrenpay", "https://www.warrenpay.com/", target: "_blank" %> (React, Redux)</li>
              </ul>
