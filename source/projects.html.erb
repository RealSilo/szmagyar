              <h4><u>RAILS</u></h4>
              <p>I decided to pick up web development to be able to implement the <u><%= link_to "FASKYN", "http://faskyn.com", target: "_blank" %></u> app. The code can be found on <u><%= link_to "GitHub", "https://github.com/faskyn/faskyn" %></u>. The app aims to make the communication simple between products and corporates.</p> 
              <p>My choice of framework was Ruby on Rails because it's great to develop documentlike apps quickly and it's easier to learn thanks to the it's maturity and the huge community behind it.</p>

              <p>As I developed the FASKYN app alone I needed quick solutions to be able to iterate faster. Thanks to that the full stack is the following: RoR, jQuery, SASS, Bootstrap, AJAX, Heroku, Postgres, Puma, AWS (S3 and Cloudfront), Redis, Sidekiq, Pusher, RSpec, Capybara.</p>

              <h4><u>MIDDLEMAN</u></h4>
              <p>Besides RoR I also use Middleman (for instance this site which is also on <u><%= link_to "GitHub", "https://github.com/RealSilo/szmagyar", target: "_blank" %></u>) which is an awesome easy-to-use framework for Rails developers to build static websites.</p>

              <h4><u>REACT</u></h4>
              <p>I also enjoy playing around with react.js. I think it's way better to use it in Rails apps than spaghetti jQuery. Some small apps I built with react:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><%= link_to "BART schedule", "http://bartschedulesilo.herokuapp.com/", target: "_blank" %></li>
                <li><%= link_to "Todo app", "http://reacttodosilo.herokuapp.com/" %></li>
              </ul>

              <p>At the moment I'm using a MacBook Pro with iTerm, Sublime, OhMyZSH, HomeBrew and Chrome. My dotfiles are also available on <u><%= link_to "GitHub", "https://github.com/RealSilo/dotfiles", target: "_blank" %></u>.</p>
